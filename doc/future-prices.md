### 2020 ###
##### February #####
We didn't make Fallon yet probably, but we were on Good Morning America, which we'll have
to settle with for now

Lot of people ready to jump onboard; at this point Fallon has to say yes. We go on Fallon and
play Flip Cup with Daniel Dey-Lewis.

Here's where we separate the real from the fake. We need to make sure we only have real ones
invested in Litcoin so we see who's in it for the long haul.
> $1030

##### November #####
Unfortunately, the previous dip caused a lot of people to buy in, no doubt fake ones too.
Have to really get people to jump ship
> $17.45

### 2021 ###
##### January #####
Unfortunately there have been over a dozen Litcoin-related suicides, but we can't say we didn't warn them.
Still, have to show there's some hope over the horizon
> $110.00

##### April #####
Have to keep them honest still.
> $73.90

##### December #####
Probably too much work to maintain at this point, so we'll just set it really high and get some money
> $34922.50

*Peace out*
